# SpendWise - Hackathon Project

SpendWise was our team project for the Codeathon 2025 (Hackathon by Manipal Institute of Technology), where we placed **#6** among numerous talented participants. Our goal was to create an AI-driven financial assistant that not only helps users track their expenses but also helps them build healthier financial habits through machine learning, balance prediction, and behavioural nudges. The project aims to provide young adults with the tools they need to manage their money in a fun, engaging, and proactive way.

## Problem Statement

Young adults face significant challenges when it comes to managing their finances. With easy access to one-click shopping, subscription traps, and impulse-driven purchases influenced by social media, it's no wonder that saving and budgeting are often pushed to the backburner. Despite various budgeting tools available, most are passive — they only show what has already happened, after the damage is done.

The result?  
- **Monthly budgets are blown by the 10th.**  
- **Savings are always "next month's" priority.**  
- **Guilt replaces financial goals.**

This leads to financial stress, low confidence in savings, and the inability to meet long-term goals, such as building investments, creating emergency funds, or even going on vacations.

## Our Solution: Make Money Talk — Literally

SpendWise is an AI-powered financial assistant designed to help young adults make smarter financial decisions. Unlike traditional budgeting apps that merely track expenses, SpendWise actively helps users prevent impulsive spending, predict balances, and manage their finances effectively.

## Features

- **Smart Nudges**: Predict impulsive purchases and suggest alternatives.
- **Finance Advisor Chatbot**: Ask financial questions and get AI-driven advice.
- **Impulsive Expense Prediction**: Machine learning to detect and prevent impulsive spending.
- **Gamified Financial Challenges**: Make saving and budgeting fun through streaks and rewards.
- **Financial Score**: Track and improve your financial habits.
